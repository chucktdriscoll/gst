//Allocate a new qos event with the given values.
//The QOS event is generated in an element that wants an upstream element to either reduce or increase its rate
//because of high/low CPU load or other resource usage such as network performance or throttling.
//Typically sinks generate these events for each buffer they receive.
//
//type indicates the reason for the QoS event.
//GST_QOS_TYPE_OVERFLOW is used when a buffer arrived in time or when the sink cannot keep up with the upstream datarate.
//GST_QOS_TYPE_UNDERFLOW is when the sink is not receiving buffers fast enough and thus has to drop late buffers.
//GST_QOS_TYPE_THROTTLE is used when the datarate is artificially limited by the application, for example to reduce power consumption.
//
//proportion indicates the real-time performance of the streaming in the element that generated the QoS event (usually the sink).
//The value is generally computed based on more long term statistics about the streams timestamps compared to the clock.
//A value < 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is producing data faster than real-time.
//A value > 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is not producing data fast enough. 1.0 is the ideal proportion value.
//The proportion value can safely be used to lower or increase the quality of the element.
//
//diff is the difference against the clock in running time of the last buffer that caused the element to generate the QOS event.
//A negative value means that the buffer with timestamp arrived in time.
//A positive value indicates how late the buffer with timestamp was.
//When throttling is enabled, diff will be set to the requested throttling interval.
//
//timestamp is the timestamp of the last buffer that cause the element to generate the QOS event.
//It is expressed in running time and thus an ever increasing value.
//
//The upstream element can use the diff and timestamp values to decide whether to process more buffers.
//For positive diff , all buffers with timestamp <= timestamp + diff will certainly arrive late in the sink as well.
//A (negative) diff value so that timestamp + diff would yield a result smaller than 0 is not allowed.
//
//The application can use general event probes to intercept the QoS event and implement custom application specific QoS handling.
//Parameters

//A pipeline has a default playback segment configured with a start position of 0, a stop position of -1 and a rate of 1.0.

//
//start_type and stop_type specify how to adjust the currently configured start and stop fields in playback segment.
//Adjustments can be made relative or absolute to the last configured values. A type of GST_SEEK_TYPE_NONE means that the position should not be updated.
//
//When the rate is positive and start has been updated, playback will start from the newly configured start position.
